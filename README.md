# AdventOfCode2022

This project contains my solutions to the [AdventOfCode 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. This year, I am doing all the code challenges in a React.js project using Typescript. The project uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) as a component library.

## Instructions to run

This project uses vite so after installing all dependencies (run `npm install` from the project root), the app can be started using: `npm run dev`
